   <p id="titlev2">The Sad Princess </p>
<p id="my">Once upon a time there was a little girl who lived in a big castle Her name was Sara. Sara wasn't aloud out of the castle but every day she dreamed of seeing the outside worl. In the 8 years she had been alive she had never steped foot outside the big gold gates that were gaured by big shinny men in armer. </p>
  <!—It ain't easy being green. -->
<p id="name">Every day sara sat in her room stairing out of the big window, sining and humming to the tune of the birds and musicly that floated in the air.  </p>
<p id="is">Sara spend her days woundering why she was stuck in her castle. every day since she has been able to utter words, sara has sat down for breakfest in the great big dinning room and asked her father why she wasnt alllowed to leave. Like clock work every time he responed becasue you are the princess of berry kindgodm and we need to keep you safe. the outside world is dangerus. <br>
  This paragraph goes right and turns into a tomato.</p>
<p id="marisa">You see long ago when sara was 1 years old  her mother the queen decied to go out in the village and grab some fresh flowers and food from the local shops in the town. but on the way the queen had an accident and was killed.</p>

  <h2>Meet the Royal Family</h2>
  <!—There are times when you may want to use the div instead of creating a table. Tables are the standard for tabular data, while div is used to define objects on the page and page layout. -->
  <p id=":)">The Family Tree</p>
  <table id="familytree">

    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <!—I could also add notes in the comments. This is pretty common. -->
 
  This exercise uses an internal CSS. CSS can also exist on its own and you can reference the file. This is called an "external style sheet." We will talk about those next.
		
  <!—Who's awesome? You're awesome. Look at that beautiful page you made! -->
